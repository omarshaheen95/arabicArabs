    | stop the clock immediately if expiry starts causing support load.
    |
    | This only controls ageing. The forced change flag an administrator raises
    | keeps working either way, and so does the password history, which is
    | switched off on its own with PASSWORD_HISTORY=0.

    | the master switch above to stop it everywhere.
    |
    | The defaults are staggered on purpose: administrators carry the widest
    | privileges, schools are seasonal users who sign in around assessment
    | rounds and are the most expensive to support.
